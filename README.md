# Rhythmdance 💃

A web application celebrating India's classical dance heritage — explore all 8 classical dance forms of India, complete with a modern, accessible UI, dark mode, and downloadable certificates.

## ✨ Features

- **8 Classical Dance Forms** — Dedicated content and unique imagery for each of India's classical dances
- **Dark Mode** — Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing
- **Certificate Generation** — Download personalized certificates as PDF
- **Modern UI** — Clean, responsive interface with a polished startup splash screen
- **Fast & Type-Safe** — Built with Next.js and TypeScript for performance and reliability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS / PostCSS
- **Linting:** ESLint
- **PDF Generation:** Client-side certificate export

## 🏗️ Software Architecture

Rhythmdance follows a **layered, component-based architecture** typical of modern Next.js applications — separating presentation, business logic, and static assets into distinct layers for maintainability and scalability.

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

    C --> D[UI Components Layer]
    D --> E[Dance Info Components]
    D --> F[Theme Toggle - Dark/Light Mode]
    D --> G[Certificate Generator Component]
    G --> H[PDF Export Service - client-side]
    C --> I[Static Assets - public/]
    I --> J[Dance Images x8]
    I --> K[Fonts / Icons / Watermarks]
    B --> L[Global State / Context Providers]
    L --> F
    B --> M[Config Layer]
    M --> N[next.config.ts]
    M --> O[tsconfig.json]
    M --> P[eslint.config.mjs]
    M --> Q[postcss.config.mjs]
```

### Architectural Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Presentation Layer** | Renders pages, routes, and layouts | `src/app/` or `src/pages/` |
| **Component Layer** | Reusable UI building blocks (dance cards, theme toggle, footer watermark, etc.) | `src/components/` |
| **State/Context Layer** | Manages global state such as dark mode toggle | `src/context/` or `src/hooks/` |
| **Service Layer** | Business logic — e.g., PDF certificate generation | `src/lib/` or `src/utils/` |
| **Static Assets** | Dance images, icons, fonts, watermark graphics | `public/` |
| **Configuration** | Build, lint, type-checking, and styling configs | Root-level config files |

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Next.js App Router** is used for file-based routing, enabling clean separation between static dance-info pages and dynamic behavior (certificate generation).
- **Client-side PDF generation** keeps certificate creation fast and serverless — no backend round-trip is required to render a downloadable PDF.
- **Theme state (dark/light mode)** is managed via React Context so any component in the tree can read/update the theme without prop drilling.
- **TypeScript throughout** enforces type safety across components, props, and utility functions, catching errors at build time.
- **Static assets are pre-bundled**, with each of the 8 classical dance forms shipping its own unique image set, served directly via Next.js's optimized asset pipeline.

### Data Flow (Certificate Download Example)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as UI Component
    participant S as PDF Service
    participant B as Browser Download

    U->>UI: Clicks "Download Certificate"
    UI->>S: Pass user data (name, dance form, etc.)
    S->>S: Generate PDF (canvas/lib-based rendering)
    S->>B: Trigger file download
    B-->>U: Certificate.pdf saved locally
```

> **Note:** This architecture is inferred from the visible project structure (Next.js + TypeScript, `public/`, `src/`, PDF/certificate features, dark mode). For a diagram that exactly matches your actual folder/module structure, share your `src/` tree or repo access and this section can be updated precisely.
